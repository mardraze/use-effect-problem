I need to update a variable, for example counter, from buttons and from WebSockets.
How to do it in react? Currently I use "useEffect" hook, but I don't think it's a correct way, 
because I'd like to avoid addEventListener and removeEventListener on every counter change.
Does anyone know a solution?
